    "# Graded Lab : Tool Use and Reflective Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will explore how AI agents can enhance research workflows by leveraging external tools and engaging in critical self-reflection. You'll learn how to build and integrate callable tools—such as web and academic search functions, and connect them to a language model using OpenAI's tool-calling API. Then, you’ll guide the agent to not only generate content but also **reflect** on its own output, improving the quality and depth of the final report. By the end of this lab, you will have implemented a mini agent capable of searching, reasoning, and publishing structured reports in HTML—laying the foundation for more advanced multi-step and autonomous AI systems."

      "   - **Study Details**: This study utilized radio observations from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array to analyze the 2011 outburst of T Pyx, a prototype yet enigmatic recurrent nova. The radio data was instrumental in tracing the evolution of the ejecta, which were consistent with thermal emission patterns typical of nova ejecta.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2. Configure the Response Call\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parameters**: Use the specified model (e.g., `\"gpt-4o-mini\"`) and set the temperature equal to the `temperature` parameter of the graded function.\n",

Radio observations provide valuable insights into these systems by investigating the interactions between the ejected nova envelope and the surrounding medium.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **MeerKAT Observations**: Recent studies with the MeerKAT radio telescope have focused on novae such as V3890 Sgr and RS Oph. These observations help elucidate the dynamic interactions during the nova eruptions by tracing radio emissions that signal the expansion and interaction of the nova ejecta with the surrounding medium ([source](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023afas.confE..56N/abstract)).\n",

By analyzing radio emissions, astronomers continue to elucidate the dynamics, composition, and evolutionary history of novae, offering insights into broader stellar and galactic processes. As observational technologies advance, the field anticipates further breakthroughs that will refine existing models and theories.\n",

      "=== Reflection on Report ===\n",
      "\n",
      "### Strengths:\n",
      "The report provides a clear and concise overview of radio observations of recurrent novae, effectively summarizing key discoveries and studies in the field. The organization is logical, with distinct sections that guide the reader through the topic. The citations are relevant and support the claims made, demonstrating a solid engagement with current literature. The historical context adds depth to the discussion, illustrating the evolution of understanding in this area.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Limitations:\n",
      "While the report summarizes several key studies, it lacks a critical analysis of the methodologies used in these observations. Additionally, the report does not discuss the implications of the findings in detail, nor does it address any controversies or differing viewpoints within the field. The conclusion, while summarizing the content, could be more forward-looking regarding future research directions.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suggestions:\n",
      "To improve the report, consider including a section that critically evaluates the methodologies of the studies mentioned, discussing their strengths and weaknesses. Expanding on the implications of the findings would provide a more comprehensive understanding of their significance. Including a discussion of alternative theories or controversies would enrich the analysis. Finally, the conclusion should be expanded to suggest specific future research directions or questions that remain unanswered.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Opportunities:\n",
      "Future research could explore the long-term evolution of radio emissions from recurrent novae and their relationship with other astrophysical phenomena. Investigating the role of different companion star types in influencing nova behavior could also be a valuable avenue. Additionally, advancements in observational technology may allow for more detailed studies of the ejected material and its interactions with the surrounding medium, potentially leading to new discoveries in the field of stellar evolution. \n",

      "### Overview of Radio Observations of Recurrent Novae\n",
      "\n",
      "Recurrent novae (RNe) are a type of cataclysmic variable star system consisting of a white dwarf and an evolved companion star in close orbit. These systems undergo repeated thermonuclear eruptions on the white dwarf's surface, expelling material at high velocities, often multiple times within a century. Radio observations provide valuable insights into these systems by investigating the interactions between the ejected nova envelope and the surrounding medium.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Key Discoveries and Studies\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **MeerKAT Observations**: Recent studies with the MeerKAT radio telescope have focused on novae such as V3890 Sgr and RS Oph. These observations elucidate the dynamic interactions during the nova eruptions by tracing radio emissions that signal the expansion and interaction of the nova ejecta with the surrounding medium ([source](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023afas.confE..56N/abstract)). The methodologies employed in these observations, including the sensitivity and resolution of the MeerKAT telescope, have allowed for unprecedented insights into the dynamics of these systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **T Pyxidis (T Pyx)**: T Pyx, a well-known but peculiar recurrent nova, underwent an outburst in 2011. Radio observations with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array indicated that the nova ejecta exhibited complex mass loss phenomena, contributing to our understanding of the dynamics involved during recurrent nova eruptions ([source](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...785...78N/abstract)). The findings challenge previous models of mass loss and suggest a need for revised theoretical frameworks.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **RS Ophiuchi**: Low-frequency radio observations during the 2021 outburst of RS Ophiuchi have been particularly telling. The brightness temperature indicated a non-thermal origin for the radio emissions, differing significantly from those observed in classical novae, which typically display thermal emissions ([source](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/523/1/132/7159730)). This difference raises questions about the underlying mechanisms driving these emissions and their implications for our understanding of nova behavior.\n",

This evolution reflects a broader shift in the field towards a more nuanced understanding of stellar phenomena.\n",

      "#### Comprehensive Reviews\n",
